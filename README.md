##BDD based Selenium project for e-bot7-Sandbox

I have used cucumber framework and MAVEN Project to organize the test cases.

###To Run

Please run `TestRunner` class from `src/main/java/runner` package.

It will execute feature file from `features` package using the step definition 
present under `steps.definitions` package.

This is a simple feature to only test the Search Bar functionality. 
And we can update the value of class variable 'searchVal' if we want to search with any other value.
